# App

![spec](/graphs/app.svg)

In Carry application all the code you write is encapsulated behind a single **app** instance. 
An app is a map with keys:

* `:model` - a read-only atom, an in-memory representation of an app state
* `:dispatch-signal` - a function for interaction with an app, always returns nil

One can imagine an app to be a black box which exposes its current state and modifies it on getting signals from an external world.
It can also affect an external world as a response to a signal, i.e. perform "side effects".

# Model

# Signals

# Spec

In order to create an instance of a Carry app a user has to pass a **spec** into `app` function:

```cljs
(def my-app (carry/app my-spec))
```

A spec is a map with keys:

* `:initial-model` - an initial model value
* `:control` - a function for handling signals
* `:reconcile` - a function for handling actions

In other words, a spec is needed to define a runtime behavior of an app:
